When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Initially, I was under the impression that I would only want to use remote when
I am working with others. However, after thinking about it and becoming more 
proficient with Git/GitHub, it feels essential to use remotes as they can free
the developer to work anywhere and with any machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

For exactly the same reason as you want to manually decide when to commit a
change. Automatic ambiguous changes can cause more problmes (in the long run)
than solutions. The purpose of git is to make you a more EFFICIENT
programmer. Introducing errors via automated pull and push request defeats that
purpose.
