When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Initially, I was under the impression that I would only want to use remote when
I am working with others. However, after thinking about it and becoming more 
proficient with Git/GitHub, it feels essential to use remotes as they can free
the developer to work anywhere and with any machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

For exactly the same reason as you want to manually decide when to commit a
change. Automatic ambiguous changes can cause more problmes (in the long run)
than solutions. The purpose of git is to make you a more EFFICIENT
programmer. Introducing errors via automated pull and push request defeats that
purpose.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Fork is the "clone" command (strictly) under the context of GitHub.

Clone is a copy of repository (either from GitHub to local or from a local
directory to another local directory) with meta data that is actionable by git.

Branch is a separation of two paths in the commit history of a
repository. Either locally housed or remotely.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

It enables one to work with confidence concerning the most recent changes and
helps work entirely offline knowing that every committed changes in the remote
repository until that moment resides in your local repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

I wouldn't: since learning about version control (GitHub) last year, I have
mandated that every member of the lab learn the software. As to the second
question, it would be easier to send files without the Git based overhead, but
it would be MUCH harder to track changes (version/history control) and even
more difficult to know when something has gone wrong in the code base. Git(Hub)
helps to keep those information obvious, thereby preventing, otherwise, 
difficult to track errors.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly 
in master?  What benefits does each approach have?

Admittedly, the round-about method of using pull request requires it's own
dissertation just to understand, the methodology is so that changes can be
reviewed by other members of the project BEFORE they are incorporated into the
master (live) branch of the project. The idea is to add multiple
points-of-failure in order to increase the robustness of the code base. Even
though it WILL still take me a while to wrap my head around the pull request
workflow, I can already appreciate the purpose of it all.

I wrote the above paragraph about 8 months ago, and it is still taking a while
just to completely understand the pull request workflow. Perhaps due to
inconsistent utilization of git.
