When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Initially, I was under the impression that I would only want to use remote when I
am working with others. However, after thinking about it and becoming more 
proficient with Git/GitHub, it feels essential to use remotes as they can free
the developer to work anywhere and with any machine.
