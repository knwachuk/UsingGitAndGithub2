When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Initially, I was under the impression that I would only want to use remote when
I am working with others. However, after thinking about it and becoming more 
proficient with Git/GitHub, it feels essential to use remotes as they can free
the developer to work anywhere and with any machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

For exactly the same reason as you want to manually decide when to commit a
change. Automatic ambiguous changes can cause more problmes (in the long run)
than solutions. The purpose of git is to make you a more EFFICIENT
programmer. Introducing errors via automated pull and push request defeats that
purpose.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Fork is the "clone" command (strictly) under the context of GitHub.

Clone is a copy of repository (either from GitHub to local or from a local
directory to another local directory) with meta data that is actionable by git.

Branch is a separation of two paths in the commit history of a
repository. Either locally housed or remotely.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

It enables one to work with confidence concerning the most recent changes and
helps work entirely offline knowing that every committed changes in the remote
repository until that moment resides in your local repository.
